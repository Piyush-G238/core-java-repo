Lambda denotes an anonymous class/function

1. No name
2. No modifier
3. No return type

Benefits of Lambda
1. reduces lines of code
2. sequential and parallel execution support by passing behavior as an argument in methods
3. To call APIs very effectively
4. To Write more readable, maintainable and concise code
5. But it is only used with functional interface

Important rules of lambda
1. If body of lambda expression contain only one statement then curly braces are optional.
2. Java compiler also inter the type of variable passed in arguments, hence type is optional.

functional interface
If the interface contains only one abstract methods then it is functional interface.
Example: Runnable, Callable, Comparable etc.

To call lambda expression we require functional interface.
